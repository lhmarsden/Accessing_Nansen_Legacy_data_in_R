# Accessing Nansen Legacy data in R

Jupyter book showing you how to access key Nansen Legacy datasets using R.

For a more generic introduction into how to extract data and metadata from NetCDF files, this other tutorial that I have created is recommended prior reading. Here, I explain at an introductory level how NetCDF files are are structured and why, discuss the CF and ACDD conventions, and show you in more detail how to access all the different components of a classic NetCDF dataset. https://lhmarsden.github.io/NetCDF_in_R_from_beginner_to_pro/01_opening_and_understanding.html

Returning to this tutorial series now, each chapter is focused on how to extract data for a different dataset. The code is focused and tailored to each dataset.
